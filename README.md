# YOLO Protocol V0

This repository contains the core smart contracts for Yolo Protocol V0.

## üöÄ Project Introduction

Yolo Protocol V0 is an extension and continuous building of our Hackhathon Project: 
[Hackathon Devfolio](https://devfolio.co/projects/yolo-protocol-univ-hook-b899):
[Hackathon Github](https://github.com/alvinyap510/hackathon-yolo-protocol-hook):

We are currently part of the [Uniswap V4 Hook Incubator - Cohort UHI5](https://atrium.academy/uniswap), where we are evolving the protocol beyond its MVP into a production-ready modular DeFi infrastructure.

## ü§® What is YOLO Protocol?

YOLO Protocol can be understood as a modular DeFi engine that combines functionalities traditionally offered by multiple protocols ‚Äî all under the hood of a single Uniswap V4 Hook:

    - üè¶ MakerDAO/Abracadabra-like
      - An overcollateralized stablecoin YOLO USD (USY) backed by yield-bearing tokens(YBTs)
  
    - ‚öñÔ∏è Synthetix-style
      - Synthetic asset(currencies, shares, commodities) minting & swapping within Uniswap itself, without the need of any prior liquidity

    - ‚öôÔ∏è Gearbox-style
      - Execute permissionless leverage of up to 20x on YBT positions (PT-sUSDe vs USY) with low liquidation risk
