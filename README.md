GM! Welcome to the Github repository of YOLO Protocols, the Ultimate UniswapV4 Hook for DeFi Degens!

# A. Some personal notes - why are we building YOLO Protocol?

Me and my co-founder are long time DeFi users and traders, and we‚Äôve always been eager to try out new DeFi protocols in pursuit of the best yields.

Throughout our journey, we have tried and experimented with numerous yield and trading protocols such as Abracadabra, Convex, Ohm, Ve(3,3), Beefy, Yearn, Mirror Protocol, Synthetix, Pendle, Contango, Gearbox, and Kamino, and wathcing the rise and fall of many of them.

We‚Äôve always believed that yield-bearing tokens can be even better utilized, and that their value can be more fully unlocked compared to current mechanisms. We came across the Uniswap V4 Hook documentation, and were fascinated by its modular design, thinking we can build the protocol that we ourselves wanted to use the most, hence the birth of the idea for YOLO Protocol.

With YOLO Protocol, we aim to kick-start a new DeFi yield flywheel, and deliver a seamless web2-like experience for leveraged trading and yield-looping to all DeFi users and degens like us.

# B. Project Background

Some information about this project - Yolo Protocol Core-V0 is the extension and continuity of our previous Hackhathon Project: 

- [Previous Hackathon Devfolio](https://devfolio.co/projects/yolo-protocol-univ-hook-b899)
  
- [Previous Hackathon Github](https://github.com/alvinyap510/hackathon-yolo-protocol-hook)

## Hackathon Winning
- We won First Prize in Base Batch #001 Hackathon's DeFi Track - [Winning Announcement](https://x.com/base/status/1930340248086831484?s=46&t=z7o3TezWDqEiMiQE-Q3QPQ)

## Codebase Update Since Base Batch #001 Hackathon
  
- Since previous Hackathon, we have implemented varios additional features on the codebase
  
  - Fully updated the original CSMM(Constant Sum Market Making) Math into [Stable Swap Math](https://github.com/YOLO-Protocol/yolo-core-v0/blob/main/src/libraries/StableMathLib.sol) inspired by Solidly
  
  - Integrated with [Circle's Hashnote USYC Teller mechanism (yield-bearing mechanism)](https://developers.circle.com/tokenized/usyc/overview) to create native rehypothecation mechanism for the anchor pool's USDC, greatly increases the return for our LP Providers as well as create a native flywheel effect for Yolo USD (USY).
  
  - Tested out integration with [Chainlink's CCIP](https://github.com/YOLO-Protocol/yolo-core-v0/blob/main/src/cross-chain/YoloCCIPBridge.sol) and [Accross' Spoke Pool](https://github.com/YOLO-Protocol/yolo-core-v0/blob/main/src/cross-chain/YoloAcrossBridge.sol) to make Yolo Synthetic Assets natively omni-chain, as we hope that with this feature, our synthetic assets such as yKRW, yJPY, yEUR, yGOLD, yTSLA, yNVDA etc. will be able to gain greater adoption beyond speculation and leveraged trading.
  
  - We have implemented a [Hybrid Oracle Mechanism](https://github.com/YOLO-Protocol/yolo-core-v0/blob/main/src/oracles/ChainlinkFunctionsHybridOracle.sol) - combining <b>Chainlink's Push-based Price Feed with Chainlink Functions</b>. Since we will be enabling leveraged trading with synthetic assets, an accurate pricing model is crucial to ensure the solvency. With he hybrid oracle model, anyone can request Chainlink Functions to execute serverless functions and push the data on-chain, and this mechanism greatly enables liquidators to spot and effectively liquidating undercollateralized positions promptly.


## Incubator Placement

- We are currently part of the [Uniswap V4 Hook Incubator - Cohort UHI5](https://atrium.academy/uniswap), where we are evolving the protocol beyond its MVP into a <b>production-ready modular DeFi infrastructure</b>.
  
- We are super excited to share with you that we are accepted as an incubatee of [Incubase - an incubator joint ventured between Base & Hashed Emergence](https://x.com/HashedEM/status/1928437083841888411)

# C. What is YOLO Protocol?

YOLO Protocol is a modular DeFi engine built on top of Uniswap V4, combining core features of multiple blue-chip protocols ‚Äî all within a single Uniswap V4 Hook:

    - üè¶ MakerDAO/Abracadabra-like
      - An overcollateralized stablecoin YOLO USD (USY) backed by yield-bearing tokens(YBTs)
      - Natively pegged with USDC upon deployment of the hook, with natural arbitration + stability incentive module to ensure it's always on-peg
      - Functions as the anchor of the entire ecosystem, providing liquidity for all other synthetic assets, yield-looping and leveraged trading

    - ‚öñÔ∏è Synthetix-style
      - The creation of synthetic assets (currencies, shares, commodities) within Uniswap, as long as there is reliable price oracle support
      - Imagine that you can trade and swap something like yTSLA, yNVDA, yCRUDEOIL, yGOLD etc inside Uniswap V4, we make this possible without the need of hectic liquidity providing process, all made possible by Uniswap V4 Hooks's custom swap overriding feature

    - ‚öôÔ∏è Gearbox-style
      - Utilizig Yolo USD's liquiditu, execute permissionless leverage of up to 20x on YBT positions (PT-sUSDe vs USY) with low liquidation risk

    - üìà eToro-like web2 style CFD trading experience (future iteration)
      - Since YOLO Protocol has the ability to create synthetic assets on-chain, future iteration we plan to expand it into an <b>on-chain CFD-like experience trading platform</b> utilizing the aforementioned core features of YOLO Protocol's Hook. 
  > (<b>Think about an on-chain eToro / Plus500 / IG.com, where you can execute on-chain 20x leverage by collateralizing USY, and being liquidated promptly</b>)


# D. Project Architecture

An overview of the entire project architecture of YOLO Protocl V0 is available over here:
- [YOLO Architecture](https://excalidraw.com/#json=U5HE_AstJCEVqrD-s6c01,_S1fhWnuP2oIuqs2w54UPA)

## Key Features to Explore

1. **Liquidity Management**: Add/remove liquidity to USDC/USY anchor pool
2. **Synthetic Asset Trading**: Swap synthetic assets without prior liquidity
3. **Collateralized Borrowing**: Deposit collateral and borrow against it
4. **Flash Loans**: Utilize instant liquidity for arbitrage and liquidations
5. **Interest Accrual**: Time-based compound interest on borrowed positions
6. **Liquidation System**: Oracle-triggered liquidations with penalties

## Project Structure

- `src/core/` - Main protocol contracts (YoloHook, YoloOracle)
- `src/libraries/` - Mathematical libraries (StableMath, FullMath)
- `src/interfaces/` - Contract interfaces
- `test/` - Comprehensive test suite
- `script/` - Deployment and utility scripts

## Important Components

- `YoloHook.sol` - Tha main body of the entry protocol, where users interact with to mint, borrow, repay synthetic assets. Also functions as the hook that manages all of the logics of Yolo Protocol's pool in Uniswap V4
  - `RehypothecationLogic.sol` - Store the logic of the rehypothecation mechanism, and the interaction with Circle's Hashnote USYC
  - `SyntheticAssetLogic.sol` - Store the logic for all synthetic asset relation operations, including creation, liquidation, solvency checks etc.
  - `YoloOracle.sol` - Inspired by AaveOracle, aggregates and abstract away all oracle price feed calls for the protocol
  - `YoloStorage` - Storage layout of YoloHook, for delegate call purpose to logic contracts
  - `StableMathLib` - Stores the Stable Swap Math Logic ```YX^3 + XY^3 = K```, based on Solidly's Math
- `cross-chain/` - Stores different methods implemented and experimented for cross-chain mechanism
- `oracles/` - Stores customized oracles
- `rehypo/` - Stores rehypothecation related contracts. For now it's a Mock USYC Teller - a simulation of USYC Teller on Ethereum Mainnet
- `tokenization/` - All ERC20 tokens used in the protocol. In future may add LP Token to represent anchor pool positions
- `mocks/` - Stores all mock contracts
