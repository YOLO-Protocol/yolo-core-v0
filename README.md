GM! Welcome to the Github repository of YOLO Protocols, the Ultimate UniswapV4 Hook for DeFi Degens!

## Some personal notes - why are we building YOLO Protocol?

## Project Background

Some information about this project - Yolo Protocol Core-V0 is the extension and continuity of our previous Hackhathon Project: 

- [Previous Hackathon Devfolio](https://devfolio.co/projects/yolo-protocol-univ-hook-b899)
  
- [Previous Hackathon Github](https://github.com/alvinyap510/hackathon-yolo-protocol-hook)

### Hackathon Winning
- We won First Prize in Base Batch #001 Hackathon's DeFi Track - [Winning Announcement](https://x.com/base/status/1930340248086831484?s=46&t=z7o3TezWDqEiMiQE-Q3QPQ)

### Codebase Update Since Base Batch #001 Hackathon
- The Hackathon codebase is just early Proof-of-Concept of our idea - How to creat
  
- Since previous Hackathon, we have implemented varios additional features on the codebase
  
  - Fully updated the original CSMM(Constant Sum Market Making) Math into [Stable Swap Math](https://github.com/YOLO-Protocol/yolo-core-v0/blob/main/src/libraries/StableMathLib.sol) inspired by Solidly
  
  - Integrated with [Circle's Hashnote USYC Teller mechanism (yield-bearing mechanism)](https://developers.circle.com/tokenized/usyc/overview) to create native rehypothecation mechanism for the anchor pool's USDC, greatly increases the return for our LP Providers as well as create a native flywheel effect for Yolo USD (USY).
  
  - Tested out integration with [Chainlink's CCIP](https://github.com/YOLO-Protocol/yolo-core-v0/blob/main/src/cross-chain/YoloCCIPBridge.sol) and [Accross' Spoke Pool](https://github.com/YOLO-Protocol/yolo-core-v0/blob/main/src/cross-chain/YoloAcrossBridge.sol) to make Yolo Synthetic Assets natively omni-chain, as we hope that with this feature, our synthetic assets such as yKRW, yJPY, yEUR, yGOLD, yTSLA, yNVDA etc. will be able to gain greater adoption beyond speculation and leveraged trading.
  
  - We have implemented a [hybrid oracle mechanism](https://github.com/YOLO-Protocol/yolo-core-v0/blob/main/src/oracles/ChainlinkFunctionsHybridOracle.sol) - combining Chainlink's Push-based Price Feed with Chainlink Functions. Since we will be enabling leveraged trading with synthetic assets, an accurate pricing model is crucial to ensure the solvency. With he hybrid oracle model, anyone can request Chainlink Functions to execute serverless functions and push the data on-chain, and this mechanism greatly enables liquidators to spot and effectively liquidating undercollateralized positions promptly.


### Incubator Placement

- We are currently part of the [Uniswap V4 Hook Incubator - Cohort UHI5](https://atrium.academy/uniswap), where we are evolving the protocol beyond its MVP into a <b>production-ready modular DeFi infrastructure</b>.
  
- We are super excited to share with you that we are accepted as an incubatee of [Incubase - an incubator joint ventured between Base & Hashed Emergence](https://x.com/HashedEM/status/1928437083841888411)

## What is YOLO Protocol?

YOLO Protocol is a modular DeFi engine built on top of Uniswap V4, combining core features of multiple blue-chip protocols ‚Äî all within a single Uniswap V4 Hook:

    - üè¶ MakerDAO/Abracadabra-like
      - An overcollateralized stablecoin YOLO USD (USY) backed by yield-bearing tokens(YBTs)
  
    - ‚öñÔ∏è Synthetix-style
      - Synthetic assets (currencies, shares, commodities) minting & swapping within Uniswap itself, without the need of any prior liquidity

    - ‚öôÔ∏è Gearbox-style
      - Execute permissionless leverage of up to 20x on YBT positions (PT-sUSDe vs USY) with low liquidation risk

Since YOLO Protocol has the ability to create synthetic assets on-chain, future iteration we plan to expand it into an <b>on-chain CFD-like experience trading platform</b> utilizing the aforementioned core features of YOLO Protocol's Hook. 
  > (<b>Think about an on-chain eToro / Plus500 / IG.com, where you can execute on-chain 20x leverage by collateralizing USY, and being liquidated promptly</b>)

## How to run

### 1. Make sure you have git, foundry and pnpm installed

### 2. Git clone this repo to your local directory
```
git clone git@github.com:YOLO-Protocol/yolo-core-v0.git
cd yolo-core-v0
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```
forge install
pnpm install
```

### 4. Run the tests
```
forge test
```

## What You Can Do

### Development Commands

```bash
# Build the contracts
forge build

# Run all tests
forge test

# Run tests with detailed output
forge test -vvv

# Run specific test
forge test --match-test testAddLiquidity

# Check contract sizes
forge build --sizes

# Format code
forge fmt

# Generate gas report
forge test --gas-report

# Run static analysis
forge analyze
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Create .env file with your RPC_URL and PRIVATE_KEY
cp .env.example .env

# Deploy to testnet
forge script script/Script01_DeployTestnet.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast

# Verify contracts (after deployment)
forge verify-contract <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <CONTRACT_NAME> --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

### Testing & Development

- **Run comprehensive test suite**: 22 test cases covering liquidity, swaps, borrowing, liquidations, and flash loans
- **Test individual components**: Use `--match-test` to run specific functionality tests
- **Gas optimization**: Analyze gas usage with `--gas-report` flag
- **Contract size monitoring**: Check size limits with `--sizes` flag

### Key Features to Explore

1. **Liquidity Management**: Add/remove liquidity to USDC/USY anchor pool
2. **Synthetic Asset Trading**: Swap synthetic assets without prior liquidity
3. **Collateralized Borrowing**: Deposit collateral and borrow against it
4. **Flash Loans**: Utilize instant liquidity for arbitrage and liquidations
5. **Interest Accrual**: Time-based compound interest on borrowed positions
6. **Liquidation System**: Oracle-triggered liquidations with penalties

### Project Structure

- `src/core/` - Main protocol contracts (YoloHook, YoloOracle)
- `src/libraries/` - Mathematical libraries (StableMath, FullMath)
- `src/interfaces/` - Contract interfaces
- `test/` - Comprehensive test suite
- `script/` - Deployment and utility scripts
