# YOLO Protocol V0

This repository contains the core smart contracts for Yolo Protocol V0.

## üöÄ Project Introduction

Yolo Protocol V0 is an extension and continued development of our Hackhathon Project: 
[Hackathon Devfolio](https://devfolio.co/projects/yolo-protocol-univ-hook-b899):
[Hackathon Github](https://github.com/alvinyap510/hackathon-yolo-protocol-hook):

We are currently part of the [Uniswap V4 Hook Incubator - Cohort UHI5](https://atrium.academy/uniswap), where we are evolving the protocol beyond its MVP into a production-ready modular DeFi infrastructure.

## ü§® What is YOLO Protocol?

YOLO Protocol is a modular DeFi engine built on top of Uniswap V4, combining core features of multiple blue-chip protocols ‚Äî all within a single Uniswap V4 Hook:

    - üè¶ MakerDAO/Abracadabra-like
      - An overcollateralized stablecoin YOLO USD (USY) backed by yield-bearing tokens(YBTs)
  
    - ‚öñÔ∏è Synthetix-style
      - Synthetic assets (currencies, shares, commodities) minting & swapping within Uniswap itself, without the need of any prior liquidity

    - ‚öôÔ∏è Gearbox-style
      - Execute permissionless leverage of up to 20x on YBT positions (PT-sUSDe vs USY) with low liquidation risk

Since YOLO Protocol has the ability to create synthetic assets on-chain, future iteration we plan to expand it into an <b>on-chain CFD-like experience trading platform</b> utilizing the aforementioned core features of YOLO Protocol's Hook. 
  > (<b>Think about an on-chain eToro / Plus500 / IG.com, where you can execute on-chain 20x leverage by collateralizing USY, and being liquidated promptly</b>)
